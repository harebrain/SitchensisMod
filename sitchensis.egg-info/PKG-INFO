Description: # Sitchensis
        python-based program to error check and calculate geometry of  3D tree crown-mapping data
        
        ### What is this repository for? ###
        
        * This program will take 3D tree mapping data collected in the field and calculate whole-tree geometry. It will go through several steps
        * along the way to first error check and visualize the data before actually calculating the final numbers. The data are imported from a 
        * single provided excel template for each tree. 
        
        * Version: 0.0.1
        
        ### How do I get set up? ###
        
        * At present this is just a script in python so you will need to intall a version of python with a lot of packages. I recommend the 
        * anaconda installation. 
        
        * Configuration: I don't know what this means yet
        
        * Dependencies: Python 3.x, xlrd, pandas 0.21.0 or greater, numpy, matplotlib, tkinter, sys, os, scipy, xlsxwriter, visual, numbers, all .py files in the Sitchensis folder
        
        * Database configuration: I don't know what this means yet
        
        * How to run: Use the provided excel template to enter data. Save data into any directory. Run the "MainBodyScript.py" to navigate to file in directory. Outputs are placed into new subfolder called "Sitchensis outputs"
        
        * How to run tests: What do you get when you cross and elephant and a rhino? HellifIknow
        
        * Deployment instructions: I don't know what this means.
