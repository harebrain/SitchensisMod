    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/

    # specification here:
    # https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name

    # Versions should comply with PEP 440:
    # https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
